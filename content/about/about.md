137.is a project created by Gianni Pojani, to study some of the most beautiful things that they knows.

The project is still in its infancy, and it is not yet clear what the final form will be, and this is done by design. 
The project is open source, and anyone can contribute to it, but there will be a set of rules that initially will be decided by the creator, but later will be decided by the community.
